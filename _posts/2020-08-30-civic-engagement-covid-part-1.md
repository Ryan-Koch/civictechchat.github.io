This is the first of two episodes where we'll talk to folks who are leading organizations trying to make civic involvement easier despite the constraints of COVID-19. For this one, we're joined by [Bhavini Patel](https://twitter.com/bhavinipatel_){:target="_blank"} to chat with us about their platform Be the Change which seeks to facilitate connections between constituents and state legislators.
