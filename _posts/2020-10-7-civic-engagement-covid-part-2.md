This is the second of two episodes where we'll talk to folks who are leading organizations trying to make civic involvement easier despite the constraints of COVID-19. For this one, we're joined by [Maria Yuan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariayuan/){:target="_blank"} to chat with us about their platform IssueVoter which seeks to inform folks about Congress and empower them to connect with its members.
